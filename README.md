# DictionaryWeatherBot
This bot program is not an AI chatbot. However, it shows weather forecasts by city input and can define, translate, and find synonyms by word input.

(Please remember, this program utilizes web api from openweathermap.org/api and https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/. In order for the program to work, you will need to get app id and app keys in order for the json data retrieval to work.)

Enjoy!
